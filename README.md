# emmMath (WIP)

Implemention of several mathematical principles in C++ using OOP

## TODO FOR emmMATH: 
- Add header files
- LaTeX & stream support
- Linear algebra support
	- Matrix implementation
	- Vector impkementation
	- Matrix and vector arithmetic
	- Kernal, Column space, row space
	- Gauss-Jordan 
	- Matrix inversion
	- Determinate algorithm
	- Diagonalization, including orthogonal diagonalization
	- Vector arithmetic 
- Greater support for Calculus principles 
- More extensive class for handling real functions
- Improve documentation
- Implment overloading to allow Rational and Complex Vectors/Matricies/Polynomials 

Just a warning that I do not have a degree in mathematical analysis so programmer discretion is advised.
